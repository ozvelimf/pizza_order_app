# Pizza Order System #

## Coded by [Muhammet Ozveli](https://github.com/ozvelimf) and [Metehan Baştaş](https://github.com/morsprincipiumest) ##

<p> This is our first project dedicated to Global AI Hub's Akbank Python Bootcamp

Not too complicated, system will show order history first, then a menu then will wait you to make your choises. Then It will ask for your credentials(ofc you don't have to use the real ones :)) (But even the fake T.C. Identity Number must be 11 digits) 

Then code will save the credentials plus the pizza you want, encoding the password with sha256 It will exit.

At background, It will save these infos into a CSV file, dividing them by column to excel. You can see this file at 'data_file/Orders_Database.csv'.<p>
